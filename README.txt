UnblockedPirateBay.com v1.1-Freedom

This software is a fork of UnblockedPirateBay.com.

The license is uncertain, but it is publicly available for no cost,
with no listed license terms. Therefore, it will be assumed to be Public Domain.

This version removes all ads, badly inserted credits
that may have been considered harmful to web browsers,
and replaced links that directed to ads, along with removing
Login and Register links in order to reduce the number of
users logging in through proxies. Please don't do it!

This version is also completetly decoded.
Encoding as in the original version of this scrupt prohibits the usage
of opcode caches, which I, myself use, and can increase performance more
than I believe that encoding could do.

A demonstration of a completely stock installation of this software is at
http://tpbp.theoks.net/. Not even configuration.php has changed.
