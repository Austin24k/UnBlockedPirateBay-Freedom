UnblockedPirateBay.com v1.1-Freedom

This software is a fork of UnblockedPirateBay.com.

The license is uncertain, but it is publicly available for no cost,
with no listed license terms. Therefore, it will be assumed to be Public Domain.

This version removes all ads, badly inserted credits
that may have been considered harmful to web browsers,
and replaced links.

This version is also completetly decoded.
Encoding prohibits the usage of opcode caches, which I, myself use,
and can increase performance more than encoding ever supposedly could.
